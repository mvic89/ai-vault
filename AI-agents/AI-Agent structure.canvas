		{"id":"c49807081a821c9a","type":"text","text":"Here’s a high-level process plus details of each phase:\n\n### 1. Define the Goal & Scope\n\n- Decide **what you want the agent to achieve**: e.g., “When a new lead arrives, enrich the data and send a personalized email.”\n    \n- Define **what environment** the agent will operate in (which apps, what data sources) — this is like defining the “environment” and “sensors/actuators” from the agent model.\n    \n- Choose the **trigger conditions** (when does the agent activate) and the **actions** it will take.\n    \n\n### 2. Create the Agent in Zapier\n\n- Go to the Zapier Agents dashboard (e.g., at agents.zapier.com). [Zapier+2Zapier+2](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/24393442652557-Build-an-agent-in-Zapier-Agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Click “+ New agent” (or use a template) to begin. [Zapier+1](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/24393442652557-Build-an-agent-in-Zapier-Agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- You’ll be prompted to either start with custom instructions (natural language) or choose a template with predefined logic. [Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/24393442652557-Build-an-agent-in-Zapier-Agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n\n### 3. Connect the Apps / Data Sources\n\n- Specify which apps/tools the agent will _use_ (these are your “actuators” / “effectors”), and which data sources (for “perception” or “state”). For example: connect Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, your CRM. [Zapier+1](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- For data sources: you may upload docs, connect to Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion etc so the agent can read or reference background knowledge. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Authenticate the apps so Zapier can act on them on behalf of the agent.\n    \n\n### 4. Specify the Trigger & Workflow Logic\n\n- Choose how the agent is triggered: On-demand, scheduled, or via another app’s event. [Zapier+1](https://zapier.com/de/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- In the “Instructions” field you write what you want the agent to _do_. You can use plain language. Zapier will help optimize your prompt. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Within the instructions you’ll insert or reference:\n    \n    - Tools (apps) the agent uses\n        \n    - Data sources\n        \n    - Actions to be executed\n        \n- Example: “When a new lead enters Sheet X, agent should fetch company LinkedIn profile, enrich the data, add to CRM, then send email to sales team.”\n    \n\n### 5. Test & Iterate\n\n- Use the test panel to simulate the trigger and see how the agent behaves. [Zapier+1](https://zapier.com/de/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Check for failures or “Needs action” flags — situations where the agent needs human input. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/de/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Refine the instructions, add extra constraints or guardrails (e.g., approval steps before sending emails) if necessary. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n\n### 6. Enable & Monitor the Agent\n\n- Once you’re satisfied, flip the toggle to “on” so the agent runs automatically. [Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/24393442652557-Build-an-agent-in-Zapier-Agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Monitor performance: logs of activities, errors, where needs human intervention. Use this to refine prompts over time. [Zapier+1](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- Consider access control: you can share the agent with team members (viewer/editor/owner roles).","x":3992,"y":340,"width":757,"height":1480},

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- **Use templates**: Zapier provides templates for common agent types (lead enrichment, support routing, email management). [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- **Provide context and examples** in the agent’s instructions — this improves output quality. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- **Add guardrails** for critical actions (e.g., human approval) if perfect accuracy is required. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-agents-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- **Monitor and iterate**: Use logs and “needs action” flags to catch edge-cases and refine. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/de/blog/zapier-agents-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n    \n- **Be aware of limitations**: The agent may “improvise” and not be precise.

Better to modularize.

		{"id":"115a7ba301f7b48a","type":"text","text":"## Goal\n----\nWhen a **new lead** appears in a Google Sheet (or your CRM), the AI agent should:\n\n1. Analyze and qualify the lead (based on company size, email domain, notes, etc.).\n    \n2. Enrich the lead with LinkedIn or Clearbit data.\n    \n3. Send a personalized Slack message to the sales team with the qualification result and next action.","x":5080,"y":637,"width":600,"height":343},
		{"id":"610f88f998bb34e5","type":"text","text":"## Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n**Step 1: Define the Workflow Logic**\n\nIn plain English:\n\n> “Whenever a new row is added to my Google Sheet called `Inbound Leads`, analyze the lead information, determine whether it’s a good fit, and send a summary to Slack.”\n\nYou’ll turn this logic into a Zapier Agent later.\n\n----\n**Step 2: Choose Your Trigger (Sensor)**\n\nIn Zapier:\n\n1. Create a **new Zapier Agent**.\n    \n2. Under **“Trigger”**, select:  \n    → **App:** Google Sheets  \n    → **Event:** “New Row Added”\n    \n3. Connect your Google account and select the correct spreadsheet + worksheet.\n    \n\nThis acts as your agent’s “sensor” — it perceives new data entering the environment.\n\n----\n**Step 3: Add Your Agent Instructions (Brain / Decision Logic)**\n\nZapier will prompt you to **describe what the agent should do** when triggered.\n\nYou could write:\n\n> **Agent Instructions:**  \n> “You are a lead qualification assistant.  \n> When a new lead appears, review the fields (Name, Email, Company, Notes).\n> \n> 1. Assess company size, industry, and relevance to our product.\n>     \n> 2. Categorize the lead as _Hot_, _Warm_, or _Cold_.\n>     \n> 3. Write a one-sentence rationale for the category.\n>     \n> 4. Prepare a Slack message summarizing the lead info and recommendation.”\n>     \n\nOptional: connect to enrichment APIs (like Clearbit or Apollo) as data sources so the agent can pull extra info about the company.\n\nThis is your decision-making layer.\n\n----------\n **Step 4: Define Actions (Actuators)**\n\nAdd a Zapier **Action Step** for where the agent sends results.\n1. **App:** Slack\n    \n2. **Event:** “Send Channel Message”\n    \n3. **Message template:**\n\t*New Lead Qualified!*\n\t*Name:* {{Lead Name}}\n\t*Company:* {{Company}}\n\t*Category:* {{Qualification}}\n\t*Reason:* {{Reasoning}}\n4. 1. Choose the Slack channel where your sales team gets notified.\n\nThese are your “actuators” — the agent takes action on the environment.\n\n----\n**Step 5: Test the Agent**\n\n- Add a new row in your Google Sheet (Name, Company, Email, Notes).\n    \n- Watch the Agent process it, qualify it, and send the Slack message.\n    \n\nIf results look off:\n\n- Refine the **instructions** (give examples of “Hot” vs “Cold”).\n    \n- Add **guardrails** like: “Never send messages with missing data.”\n\n---\n**Step 6: Deploy & Monitor**\n\nOnce satisfied:\n\n- Turn the agent **ON**.\n    \n- Check the **Zapier Activity Log** for how it’s performing.\n    \n- Occasionally adjust instructions as your qualification criteria evolve.","x":5100,"y":1137,"width":560,"height":2143},
