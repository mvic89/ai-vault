I'm going to create project called 'motorcycle-booking-engine'.

Tech-stack:
Next.js,
Tailwind CSS,
Typescript
(don't forget to have the correct '.gitignore' files')

This project is going to be a 'directory website' where you can search and find motorcycle repair shop all throughout the EU. You will be able to filter through name / country / city / brands (from dealer linked repair shops, like 'Honda' for instance. (repair shops connected to the brand).

the repair shops data will be stored in a Supabase database. (I'm open for suggestions from where to collect and data from). However, I want the search results to be of quality. So trying to find places with places that has websites, phone numbers, business listings and registered companies would be of utmost importance.

Don't forget that SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY should be hidden.

Also please include project structure and try to keep the documentation straight to the point. (keep the summary to one document with thoroughly thought about steps of how to implement all the steps).
